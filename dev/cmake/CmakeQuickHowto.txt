CMake Quick HowTo
==================

NOTE. This way of building is not used by SObjectizer developers. The projects
files for CMake were contributed by SObjectizer users and now these files
are maintained by The SObjectizer Team (but these files are not used in
SObjectizer development).

cmake & Linux/FreeBSD
=====================

  # first download so sources by svn
  # avalable tags and branches You can see in repository
  # http://sourceforge.net/p/sobjectizer/repo/HEAD/tree/
  # cmake build supported after version 5.5.2
  svn export http://svn.code.sf.net/p/sobjectizer/repo/branches/so_5 so_5
  cd so_5
  mkdir cmake_build
  cd cmake_build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=target -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../dev
  cmake --build . --config Release
  cmake --build . --config Release --target install

Those commands will create all necessary Makefile, then build SObjectizer. 

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - standard cmake variable, it contains path for final
files base installation dir. At make install files will be copied here

If it necessary to build examples and tests too, use

  cmake -DBUILD_ALL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=target ../dev

When 'make install' finished './target' will contain two subfolders
'./bin' with samples and './lib' with shared libso.5.x.x.so

If You just need to build project CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX not needed and You 
can stop after 'make' command, make install not required.

If You need (re)build project files and run tests, just

  cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ../dev
  make 
  make test

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and make install not needed (no installation).

CMake build system currently supports this custom options:

  SOBJECTIZER_BUILD_STATIC   Enable building SObjectizer as a static library [default: ON]
  SOBJECTIZER_BUILD_SHARED   Enable building SObjectizer as a shared library [default: ON]

  BUILD_ALL      Enable building examples and tests [default: OFF]
  BUILD_EXAMPLES Enable building examples [default: OFF]
  BUILD_TESTS    Enable building tests    [default: OFF]

Please note that if BUILD_ALL or BUILD_EXAMPLES or BUILD_TESTS is turned ON
then both SOBJECTIZER_BUILD_STATIC and SOBJECTIZER_BUILD_SHARED must be turned
ON. It means that if SOBJECTIZER_BUILD_STATIC or SOBJECTIZER_BUILD_SHARED is
turned OFF then BUILD_ALL/BUILD_EXAMPLES/BUILD_TESTS all must be turned OFF.

cmake & Windows
================

To build SObjectizer under Windows by MS Visual Studio 2013 from command line
You need console with properly configured compiler environment variables via
vcvarsall.bat (I start it from "Start->All Programms->Visuil Studio
2013->Tools")

  cd so-5.5.20
  mkdir cmake_build
  cd cmake_build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=target -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ../dev
  cmake --build . --config Release
  cmake --build . --config Release --target install

If it necessary to build examples too, use BUILD_ALL in cmake invocation:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=target -DBUILD_ALL=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ../dev

msbuild's Configuration argument usually can be one of "Debug", "Release",
"MinSizeRel" or "RelWithDebInfo".

The easiest way to use cmake in Windows - use it's graphical interface
cmake-gui In cmake-gui window You can choose directory, where sources placed,
where to create cmake build files. After this check "Advanced" checkbox, push
"Configure" button, choose compilation way and press "Finish". Few seconds
later You will see cmake variables list. Find "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX" and set it
to directory, where compiled files will be placed after installation stage.
Check required BUILD_ALL, BUILD_TESTS, BUILD_EXAMPLES options. Then press
"Configure", wait, then press "Generate" button.

After cmake project files generated You can bun build from command line.

Running tests from Windows
==========================

  :: run once
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=installed_files -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ../dev
  :: and after each change
  msbuild /m /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj
  run_tests.bat

run_tests.bat will temporary set PATH and run all tests. It is possible to run
tests (it You turned it on at cmake run) after building project (without
installing), but You will need to include path to so.5.x.x.dll in PATH
manually. It's because msbuild can be runned for different configurations
(Debug Release MinSizeRel RelWithDebInfo), so it append Configuration name to
compiled files pathes, but mingw32-make will not do that. But after
installation stage so.5.x.x.dll will be in known directory.

Running tests without installation (set need to be configured once if You will
not change Configuration=Release argument)

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=installed_files -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ../dev
  msbuild /m /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj
  set PATH=%PATH%;dir_with_compiled_so.5.x.x.dll
  ctest --force-new-ctest-process
  :: or msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release RUN_TESTS.vcxproj

If You certain that You know better way to use cmake crossaplatform - let me know.
san@masterspline.eu or tell SObjectizer's core developers.
